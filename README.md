# Linktree Clone

The Linktree allows you to create a personalized and customizable page that houses all the important links that you want to share with your audience. It's a link-in-bio solution that can be used on social platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Twitch, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and more. You can learn more accessing the site: [linktr.ee](https://linktr.ee/).

This repository was made for the purpose of creating a clone page of what would be a personal Linktree page.
